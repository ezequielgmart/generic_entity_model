# generic_entity_model
This repository contains a foundational Generic Entity Model (GEM) designed to streamline database interactions in Node.js applications using PostgreSQL. It serves as an agnostic set of tools for performing standard CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, abstracting away the direct pg client calls and connection management.
